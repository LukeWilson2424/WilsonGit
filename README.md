### _My Assignments_

**Assignment 4:**

This sketch of mine uses animation and user input for the first time. When opened the user will see a blue oval and a blue vertical line moving across the screen from left-to-right. This line cannot be interacted with and is only there to showcase movement within the sketch. The oval can be interacted with however. Click to make it jump forward to the right and press a key to make it slide back. If the oval touches either edge of the screen it will reset itself back to it's starting position. Once again, it's a very simple sketch that displays movement and input.

**Assignment 9:**

This assignment was our introduction to using sound elements within a p5js sketch. It also pulls in video from a webcam if permissions are given to the program to access it. For this assignment I have a grey square with the text _click to play sound_ written on it. If the user clicks a beep is played and lines appear on the square. The lines move according to the pitch of the sound that change when the user moves their mouse over the square. All colors on the screen are also inverted via a filter when sound is being played.

**Assignment 10:**

This assignment introduces video files into the p5js project. The project code is linking to a video file also found within the folder. There are mutliple formats of said video included. If a player cannot use the first format it then moves on to use next format, and so on. These formats are; .webm, .mp4, and .ogv
